# Roots of Quadratic Equations

> To find the roots of a quadratic equation, we use a special formula called 
  the quadratic formula.

  A Quadratic Equation looks like this:

  		ax2+bx+c=0

where: 

- a,b, and c are numbers, a != 0
- x is the variable we want to solve for (the roots).

## Steps to find the roots:

The **Quadratic Formula** is:

				x = -b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)/2a
				x = -b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)/2a

This formula gives us two possible values for x because of the Â± (plus or 
minus) sign.

# Here's how it works:

1. Identify a,b,c: Look at the quadratic equation and identify the values of 
				   a,b and c.

2. Calculate the Discriminant: The discriminant(d) is the part under the
							   square root in the formula:

1. if b^2 - 4ac > 0: There are two real roots.
2. if b^2 - 4ac = 0: There's exactly one real root(the two roots are the same).
3. if b^2 - 4ac < 0: There are no real roots(the roots are complex).


3. Apply the formula: Substitue the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic 
					  formula to find the roots.
